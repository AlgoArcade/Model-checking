# Model-checking
Model checking used in Automata and temporal logic

**Model checking** is a technique for verifying that a given model of a system satisfies a certain specification. In the context of automata and temporal logic, model checking involves verifying that a finite state automaton or a temporal logic formula holds for a given model of a system.
