# Model-checking
Model checking used in Automata and temporal logic


**Model checking** is a technique for automatically verifying the correctness of a model of a system. The model is typically described using a formal language, such as temporal logic or a programming language, and the model checking algorithm checks the model against a set of formal specifications or properties that the model is expected to satisfy.

Model checking algorithms work by systematically exploring the state space of the model and checking whether the specifications are satisfied at each state. This process is known as "symbolic model checking" and can be applied to a wide range of systems, including hardware designs, software systems, and biological systems.

One key advantage of model checking is that it is an automated process, which means that it can be used to verify the correctness of large and complex systems that would be impractical to check manually. Model checking algorithms are also highly efficient and can scale to handle very large models with a high degree of efficiency.

However, model checking is not a panacea and has some limitations. For example, some specifications may be too complex or difficult to express in a formal language, and some systems may be too large or too dynamic to be checked using existing model checking algorithms. In addition, model checking is only as good as the model that it is applied to, so it is important to ensure that the model is an accurate and complete representation of the system being verified.
