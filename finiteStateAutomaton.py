"""
This function takes as input a finite state automaton and a model, which is a list of transitions.
It iterates over the transitions in the model and checks whether the automaton can make a transition from its current state to the next state based on the input symbol. If the automaton can make the transition, it updates the current state. If it cannot make the transition, it returns False. If the function reaches the end of the model and the current state is a final state of the automaton, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

To implement model checking for temporal logic formulas, you can use a temporal logic model checker such as NuSMV or SPIN. 
These tools allow you to specify a model and a temporal logic formula, and they will check whether the formula holds for the model.
